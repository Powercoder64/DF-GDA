# Repository for A Dynamic Fractional Generalized Deterministic Annealing for Rapid Convergence in Deep Learning Optimization

**Abstract**:
Optimization is at the heart of all machine learning. This paper presents Dynamic Fractional Generalized Deterministic Annealing (DF-GDA), a novel physics-inspired algorithm designed to accelerate convergence and enhance stability in deep learning models. Unlike traditional methods such as stochastic gradient descent (SGD), which often suffer from slow convergence and entrapment in local minima, DF-GDA employs an adaptive, temperature-controlled mechanism that balances global exploration with precise convergence. A key innovation is its dynamic fractional parameter update, which selectively optimizes portions of the model, improving computational efficiency. DF-GDA excels in high-dimensional problems, such as image classification, by reducing the risk of local minima and increasing robustness to noisy data. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DF-GDA significantly outperforms SGD in both convergence speed and accuracy, making it a powerful alternative for large-scale, complex deep learning tasks.
